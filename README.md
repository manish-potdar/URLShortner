# OURL - A Full-Stack URL Shortener

A complete URL shortener web application built with Python and Django. This project provides a simple, clean interface to convert long, unwieldy URLs into short, memorable links. It was developed and deployed on a cloud server, and includes a full architectural design for scaling to a distributed, global-level service.

**Live Demo:** [https://ourl.app](https://ourl.app)

## Features âœ¨

  * **Shorten URLs**: Convert any valid URL into a short link.
  * **Custom Short Codes**: Users can provide their own custom, memorable codes.
  * **De-duplication**: Prevents creating multiple short links for the same destination URL, ensuring consistency.
  * **Fast Redirection**: Efficiently redirects short links to their original destination.
  * **Secure**: Deployed with a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate to enable HTTPS.

## System Architecture

The application was deployed using a robust, single-server architecture. Additionally, a complete design for a highly scalable, distributed system was architected to handle enterprise-level traffic.

  * **Deployed Architecture**: A monolithic Django application running on an Ubuntu cloud VM, served by Gunicorn and proxied by Nginx.
  * **Scalable Architecture Design**: A distributed system incorporating a load balancer, multiple stateless web servers, a NoSQL database (e.g., DynamoDB), a Redis caching layer, and a dedicated unique ID generation service to ensure high availability and low latency.

## Tech Stack

  * **Backend**: Python, Django
  * **Database**: PostgreSQL
  * **Deployment**: Nginx, Gunicorn, Systemd, Ubuntu Server
  * **Security**: Let's Encrypt (Certbot) for SSL/HTTPS
